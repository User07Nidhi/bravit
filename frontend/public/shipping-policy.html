<h1>Shipping Policy</h1>
<p>
  We ensure ease of selling and the best possible customer experience and mandate delivery to all customers via our logistics partners and deduct the shipping cost from the selling price before making a payment to you. Shipping fee is calculated on actual weight or volumetric weight, whichever is higher. This is to account for items which are lightweight but occupy a lot of shipping space.
</p>
<p>
  Volumetric weight is calculated as below: <br />
  Volumetric Weight (kilo) = L × B × H (Length × Breadth × Height)/5000 where LBH are in cm.

<p>The following rates are exclusive of all taxes:</p>
